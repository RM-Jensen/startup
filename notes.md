# Notes
## What is this document?
This document will be available during exams, so is the best place to store important class info.
The file format, .md, is expected to be treated as a markdown document, a kind of plaintext document
in which special characters are used to provide basic text richness like headings, italics, etc.

## Basics of Markdown
Newlines are inserted by ending a line with '\\'.\
Headings are created with one or more hash symbols before the text - more hashes mean a smaller heading.\
bold is denoted by \*\* **bold text** \*\* or \_\_**bold text**\_\_, which will be inserted by cmd-b\
italics (cmd-i) are single asterisk or underscore: \__italic text_\_.\
To next bold and italics, use asterisks on the outside and underscores on the inside. Triple asterisk\
makes an entire passage bold italics: \*\*\* ***extremely intense text*** \*\*\*.\
This is a \<sub><sub>subscript</sub>\</sub> text. \<sup> works the same way for superscript.\
